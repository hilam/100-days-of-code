# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 02, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Blogs, repositories and planning board are created for 
the challenge.

**Thoughts:** In addition to the challenge of coding for 100 days, with a
defined goal, I believe relevant to the challenge of maintaining blogs, in 
Portuguese and English, where I can practice other skills.

Blogs were created and opened with posts about the challenge, but
propose to continue after this first round with personal articles,
translations, and possible subsequent rounds of #100DaysOfCode.

### Day 1: January 03, 2018

**Today's Progress:** My first commit on the app repository

**Thoughts:** I started reading some books on subjects related to 
application:
 
* Flask by example
* Learning Flask framework
* Flash framework cookbook
* Github Essentials

From the opening chapters of each of them and the new Flask tutorial
of Full Stack Python, I coded over an hour, but it was a good
initial boilerplate, I hope.

### Day 2: January 04, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I plugged a Cloud Server into Host1Plus, where I 
already had a domain. First
configurations of the Ubuntu 16.04.3 Server, which will be the production 
platform. Installation of git and nginx.

**Thoughts:** It's relatively simple to get a cloud server for a good
price. It is enough that you have an international credit card. In Brazil,
 prices are still prohibitive. I did not post on Twitter or Github.


### Day 3: January 05, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 

Continued the readings; completed a Git training, which I started before 
the challenge; I matured the idea of code in Windows, using PyCharm Community, 
contrasting with another idea of using a Linux virtual machine (Debian or Ubuntu), 
using nano or vim; still, I continued the studies of the "Data Science" course
at Udemy. I registered and started watching classes in the course of 
"Statistics".

**Thoughts:** Don't post on Twitter, nor Github.


### Day 4: January 06, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 

* Updated my Docker Toolbox for Windows installation
* Created a virtual machine Ubuntu Server 16.04.3, local, to tests and 
builds, and synchronize the remote server's configuration

**Thoughts:** The plan is forming: code in Windows, with PyCharm
Community as IDE, in a virtual environment created with Anaconda and Python 3.6;
 use Docker containers (I have not yet decided which OS of the application container:
Alpine or Ubuntu?); containers for databases, testing and homologation
(local server); create mirroring mechanism of local server settings
to the remote server; create an automated deploy mechanism for the
production (remote server); question: should I use a Python distribution
or Conda on the servers? Miniconda solve? To be tested. For version 1.0
everything is practically defined in the application's feature document.
