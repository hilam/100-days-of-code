platform. Installation of git and nginx.

### R1D3

Continued the readings; completed a Git training, which I started before 
the challenge; I matured the idea of code in Windows, using PyCharm Community, 
contrasting with another idea of using a Linux virtual machine (Debian or Ubuntu), 
using nano or vim; still, I continued the studies of the "Data Science" course
at Udemy. I registered and started watching classes in the course of 
"Statistics".

* Updated my Docker Toolbox for Windows installation
* Created a virtual machine Ubuntu Server 16.04.3, local, to tests and 
builds, and synchronize the remote server's configuration
